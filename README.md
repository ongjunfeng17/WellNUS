# WellNUS

## Introduction
The WellNUS App is a mobile application designed to facilitate seamless communication and collaboration within the National University of Singapore (NUS) community. This app aims to streamline various processes and provide valuable resources to enhance productivity and engagement for both University Health Centre (UHC) employees and stakeholders within NUS.

## Features
1. Authentication System
- Supports the use of an authentication server for validating user credentials and confirming the user's identity. 
2. Events and Announcements 📢
- Users are greeted with organized events and important dates, ensuring they stay up-to-date with UHC activities.
3. Employee Directory
- A comprehensive employee directory allows users to easily search and find information regarding doctors and psychiatrists, such as ratings and contact information.
4. Appointment Booking 🩺
Users can book a medical appointment through the app (minimally a day in advance) with their preferred practitioner and head over (10-15 mins) before their appointment time, thereby saving them a sizeable amount of waiting time (up to 1.5 hrs).
5. Calender 📆
Users can access an organized calendar of their appointment dates and times, allowing them to cancel, reschedule or view their booked appointments. 
  
## Features coming in the future
1. Feedback and Suggestions 📝
